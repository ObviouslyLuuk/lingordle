add word inclusion threshold for easier games
add mode where words from different languages can be picked

use tree structure or hashing to check word validity?

rewrite all JS to be in classes Main, Game, Controls, Display, Solver
Main: has all interaction between classes and passing the args etc
Game: has all the game logic
Controls: creates the buttons and their functions, but doesn't place them
Display: places everything
Solver: has all the statistics and probabilities calculated from the game

maybe even have Keyboard in its own subclass, and maybe Board too

Make separate repos for the data/usefull stuff I've collected
